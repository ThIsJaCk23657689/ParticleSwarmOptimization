# Particle Swarm Optimization

This program will implement the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm and visualize the process by using OpenGL and SDL2.

## Prerequisites
This program uses the following libraries:
* `SDL2`
* `Glad`
* `glm`
* `Dear ImGui`

These libraries require installations, I recommend `vcpkg` for C++ package management.
